== OAuth ==

RESTful services are secured following the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0^] and OpenID Connect standards.

CAUTION: further guidelines are being worked out by the REST Security workgroup

OAuth
*	We also support and promote authorization_code (for confidental clients)
*	Client Credentials Flow:
Authentication: is that a standard or Smals specific implementation.
We use JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile as standard for authentication (RFC7523). uses a certificate to sign a jwt token as assertion.

[CAUTION]
.CBSS REMARK
====
-	Security: specify use cases present in each organization (system-to-system/user-to-system, sensitivity level, … )
*	Starting from these, standardize on technologies (e.g. OAuth2, OpenID Connect, signature, encryption, certificate formats/creation process, …)
====

First the client application has to request an _access token_ from the _Authorization Server_. There are currently 2 authorization grant flows supported to obtain an access token:

* <<Client Credentials flow>>: for authenticated applications (e.g. batch, server-side component) to obtain permissions on behalf of itself
* <<Implicit flow>>: for unauthenticated applications (e.g. JavaScript, mobile app, fat client) to obtain permission on behalf of an end-user

The access token is a https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Token or JWT (RFC 7519)^] containing an identity and list of scopes. The access token is signed to protect its integrity.

Several libraries or services (e.g. http://jwt.io[jwt.io^]) exist to visualize the content of a JWT.

The access token can be used to invoke protected resources by adding it to the ```Authorization``` HTTP header.

[subs=normal]
```
GET http://api.fgov.be/demo/hello/sayHello
Authorization: Bearer [red]#eyJhbGc#..[aqua]#FvY#
```

=== Client Credentials flow ===

This flow applies to applications that request an access token using its own client credentials (e.g. batch programs or any server-side application that accesses a resource not on behalf of an end-user)


The secrets are in _Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)_ format (PKCS#7) and include the X.509 certificate of the client and a signed random-generated string.

The client asks the Authorization Server to generate an _access token_ on its behalf

```
POST https://privateservices.socialsecurity.be/REST/oauth/clientCredential
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&
client_id=b2F1dGg6Y2xpZW50Y3JlZGVudGlhbDp0ZXN0OmZ1bGw%3D& <1>
client_secret=MIAGCS..AAA& <2>
scope=scope_demo_cc_read <3>
```

<1> `client_id` is the base64-encoded common name (`CN`) of the client X.509 certificate
<2> `client_secret` is the CMS secret previously described
<3> `scope` is the list of requested scopes necessary to invoke protected resources.


If allowed, the Authorization Server returns the ```accessToken``` in a JSON message.

[subs=normal]
```json
+HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8+
{
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGc..FvY",
    "expiresAt": "2016-12-30T11:32:21.111Z",
    "expiresIn": 599,
    "clientId": "oauth:clientcredential:test:full"
}
```


=== Implicit flow ===

This flow is optimized for clients that cannot securily store credentials client-side (e.g. Javascript in the browser, public mobile or desktop applications). The access token is issued to the end-user of the application, not the application itself.
