== Document

A document resource is a _singular concept_ that is referring to a business entity or object instance. A document’s state representation typically includes both _fields with values_ and <<links,_links_>> to other related resources.

​​`GET {API}/employers/93017373[^]`

[subs="normal"]
```json
{
  "name": "Belgacom",
  "nssoNbr": 93017373,
  "company": {
    "cbeNbr": 202239951,

  },
  "self": "{API}/employers/93017373[^]"
}

*Child resources*

A document may have _child resources_ that represent its specific subordinate concepts. Most document resources are contained in a _parent <<Collection,collection resource>>_ and define a *variable path segment with identity key*.

image::collection.png[]

When defining child resources, stick to concepts _within the same API_. An employer resource could contain child concepts as employees, debts, taxes, mandates, declarations, risks, but putting all these different concepts below a single document resource becomes unmanageable. In that case *prefer associations and create <<document-links,links>>* to other APIs from the employer resource.

*Identity key*

The _identity key_ is preferably a _natural business identifier_, uniquely identifying the business resource. If such key does not exist, a _surrogate or technical key_ (like http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122[UUID^]) can be used.

WARNING: Especially for unsecured resources, avoid technical keys that are easy to guess (for example sequential identifiers)

WARNING: Don't use database-generated keys as identity keys in your public API to avoid tight coupling between the database schema and API. Having the key independent of all other columns insulates the database relationships from changes in data values or database design (agility) and guarantees uniqueness.

=== Update

Updating a resource may be done in one of several ways.
One and only one of following patterns should be chosen per resource, unless forced by a backwards compatible change.

In order of preference:

. use PUT with complete objects to update a resource as long as feasible (i.e. do not use PATCH at all).
+
This option is preferred when clients are likely to always take into account the entire resource representation.
If a client ignores some of a resource's properties returned by a consultation, they are likely to be omitted from the PUT request and thus lost.
This scenario may occur when new properties were added during the API lifecycle.
In this case, use of PUT isn't advised.

. Use PATCH with partial objects to only update parts of a resource, whenever possible, using the JSON Merge Patch standard.
+
JSON Merge Patch is limited however, e.g. it doesn't allow for an update of a single element of an array.
If this proves to be an issue, this might however indicate that the array elements might be beter modeled as seperate subresources.

. use POST on a child resource instead of PATCH if the request does not modify the resource in a way defined by the semantics of the media type.
  See <<non-CRUD operations>> for more information.

Use of the JSON Patch standard, an alternative to JSON Merge Patch, is not recommended, as it proves to be difficult to implement.

==== Full update

Use `PUT` when you like to do a complete update of a document resource. All values are replaced by the values submitted by the client.

==== Partial update

Use `PATCH` when you like to do a partial update of a document resource.

The `PATCH` message MUST be conform to the JSON Merge Patch (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386[RFC 7386]) specification:

* JSON properties in the request overwrite the ones in the previous resource state
* properties with value `null` in the request are removed from the resource
* properties not present in the request are preserved

APIs should support both the MIME type of JSON merge patch `application/merge-patch+json` as the generic `application/json` JSON mime type.
As JSON Merge Patch requests can not be fully specified as a JSON Schema type, a MergePatch marker type should be used, defined in link:schemas/common/v1/MergePatch.yaml[MergePatch.yaml].

=== Non-CRUD operations

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Non-CRUD operations
====
If a business action isn't a standard CRUD operation on a resource, it is RECOMMENDED to model it as a child resource.

The HTTP method SHOULD be:

* POST for actions with side effects (state change) or actions without side effects but requiring a request body
* GET for idempotent actions without side effects

For actions with side effects, the child resource's name is RECOMMENDED to be a noun describing the intent of the action rather than the action itself (verb).
====

.Non-CRUD POST operation
====
​[green]#​​GOOD:  POST /account/123/withdrawals# +
[red]#​BAD:   POST /account/123/withdraw#
====

Using a noun ensures extensiblity, for example the API can be extended to consult a history of all withdrawals executed on the account.

.Non-CRUD GET operation
====
`GET /convertMoney?from=EUR&amount=45&to=USD`
====

=== Long running tasks

Some operations need to be performed asynchronously, as they take too long to complete.

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Long running tasks
====
Long running tasks MUST be represented as a resource.
The task resource is created using a POST action returning a `202 Accepted` response containing the URL of the task in the `Location` HTTP header.
It can then be fetched by the client to get the processing status of the task.

When GETting the task resource, the response can be:

* Still processing: status `200 OK` and a representation of the task's current status
* Success: status `303 See Other` with the `Location` header containing the URL of the task's output.
* Failure: status `200 OK` with a representation of the task's status, including the reason of the failure
====

Variations on the above may be required, e.g. if the task has no output, the response on success may be `200 OK` without a `Location` header.
The schema link:schemas/common/v1/LongRunningTaskStatus.yaml[LongRunningTaskStatus.yaml] defines the representation of a task's status.

.Long running task
====
*Submitting the task*

`POST /images/tasks`

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Location: http://www.example.org/images/tasks/1
Date: Sun, 13 Sep 2018 01:49:27 GMT
```
```JSON
{
  "self": "/images/tasks",
  "status": {
    "state": "processing",
    "pollAfter": "2018-09-13T01:59:27Z"
  }
}
```

The response `202 Accepted` status indicates that the server accepted the request for processing.
`pollAfter` hints when to check for an updated status at a later time.

*Getting the processing status*

`GET /images/task/1`

_When the server is still processing the task_

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```
```JSON
{
  "self": "/images/tasks/1",
  "status": {
    "state": "processing",
    "pollAfter": "2018-09-13T02:09:27Z"
  }
}
```

_When processing has completed_

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: http://www.example.org/images/1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```
```JSON
{
  "self": "/images/tasks/1",
  "status": {
    "state": "done",
    "completed":"2018-09-13T02:10:00Z",
  }
}
```

The `Location` header refers to the result of the task.

_In case of failure during processing_

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```
```JSON
{
  "self": "/images/tasks/1",
  "status": {
    "state": "failed",
    "completed":"2018-09-13T02:10:00Z",
    "problem": {
      "instance": "d9e35127-e9b1-4201-a211-2b52e52508df",
      "title": "Bad Request",
      "status": 400,
      "type": "http://example.org/errors/invalidImageFormat",
      "detail": "Invalid image format"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the status code is `200 OK` as the retrieval of the task's status succeeded.
The cause of failure is represented using an embedded Problem object, as defined in <<Error handling>>.
