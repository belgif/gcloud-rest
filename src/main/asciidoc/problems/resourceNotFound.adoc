= Resource Not Found
:nofooter:

*Status code* 404 Not Found

*Description* The requested resource cannot be found. The `detail` property reveals additional information about why the resource was not found.


Either the resource path isn't specified in the API's `/doc/swagger.yaml` specification.

```
GET /enterprises

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/problem+json

{
  "type": "urn:problem-type:belgif:resourceNotFound",
  "href": "https://www.gcloud.belgium.be/rest/problems/resourceNotFound.html",
  "status": 404,
  "title": "Resource Not Found",
  "detail": "No resource /enterprises found"
}
```

Either the path parameters don't resolve to an existing resource. Look for the more details in the `invalidParams` property.

```
