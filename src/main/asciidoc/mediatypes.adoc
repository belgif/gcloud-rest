== Media Types

*JSON*

The primary media type to support is *JSON* (Javascript Object Notation https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159[RFC 7159^]). The choice for JSON is particularly made for supporting javascript clients. 

WARNING: All internal APIs will use JSON as only data format.

Always stick to *UTF-8* encoding and specify the charset in the `Content-Type` HTTP header.

```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```

*XML*

On specific client request a REST service can expose XML messages defined by *XML Schema*.


```
Content-Type: application/xml;charset=UTF-8
```

Always stick to *UTF-8* encoding and specify the charset in the `Content-Type` HTTP header.

INFO: We don't recommend implementing both JSON / XML in each REST service. Either this is a . Automatic conversion between the two standards will almost never give a satisfying result.
