=== Embedding resources

In order to reduce the number of requests, optional embedding of subresources may be used.

.Embedding subresources
====
Embedded subresources MUST be put in a JSON object named `embedded` at root level of the JSON document.
In this object, each property key is the URI and the value the full JSON representation of the subresource.
The URI MUST be the same as the `href` value by which the subresource is referenced in the representation of the main resource.

Embedded resources are returned at the client's request if the `embed` query parameter is specified.
The name of the JSON property referencing the subresource can be used as value of the `embed` parameter.
====

This way of embedding resources limits the changes required when a clients starts to use it, and only impacts the JSON Schema type of the root document.
It also works well when there are multiple occurrences of the same subresource, and when embedding resources more than one level deep.

In JSON Schema, `additionalProperties` can be used to specify the data types allowed in `embedded`.
Note that it not possible to specify more than one data type this way in OpenAPI 2.0, so the only restriction that can be specified is  `type: object` when there are multiple embedded data types.
In OpenAPI 3.0, `oneOf` can be used to list all possible data types.
