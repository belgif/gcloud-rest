== Introduction

The main goal for introducing RESTful services is to increase flexibility and to offer web service support to client platforms not able to communicate using SOAP web services.

* REST is the defacto standard to communicate with web services from javascript and native mobile applications.
* While SOAP is strictly linked to XML and needs complex standards (MTOM, Soap-with-Attachments) to work with other media formats, RESTful services can support this natively.
* WS-* specifications added to SOAP are often overly complex and redundant to the possibilities over the underlying communication protocol (e.g. HTTP).
* REST has become the industry standard for developing APIs on the web (https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer[Google^], https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference[Facebook^], https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis[Amazon^], https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public[Twitter^], etc).
