== API specifications

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.API contract-first approach
====
The contract-first principle SHOULD be followed when developing an API.
In this approach, the specifications of the REST API are created first and not generated from the code.

A code-first approach may sometimes be necessary however, as current state of technology does not always fully support contract-first development.
In this case, special attention should be given that the API specifications remain stable and loosely coupled to the API implementation technology.
====

=== OpenAPI (Swagger)

OpenAPI is the dominating standard for API documentation, having gained wide industry support.
It is based on http://swagger.io/[Swagger^], which has been standardized as https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md[OpenAPI 2.0].

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)
====
Specifications of the API SHOULD be provided using *OpenAPI 2.0* (aka Swagger).
OpenAPI 2.0 uses the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaObject[OpenAPI Schema Object] to describe the JSON representation of resources,  which is a variant of the **JSON Schema draft 04** standard.
====

The newer OpenAPI 3.0 standard should not be used yet for now, as tooling and library support is not yet sufficiently up to date with this version.
You can visualize OpenAPI files using tools like https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI^], https://github.com/moon0326/swagger-ui-watcher[Swagger UI Watcher^] or https://senya.io[Senya^].

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Additional documentation
====
Any additional documentation SHOULD be linked from the API's OpenAPI definition using the `externalDocs` property.
====

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Use of YAML format in OpenAPI
====
OpenAPI files SHOULD be made available in YAML format, and OPTIONALLY in JSON format as well.

YAML is a superset of JSON which allows a simpler notation, and also allows comments.
According to usage, a conversion step to JSON might be necessary considering limitations of tools.
====

[[doc-resource,doc resource]]
[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.`doc` resource
====
The OpenAPI specification file and other API documentation SHOULD be placed under a special `doc` resource under the API root location.

The swagger specification file is, https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#file-structure[by convention], named `swagger.json` or `swagger.yaml`.

Root OpenAPI 3.0 documents SHOULD be named `openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml`, as specified in the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#document-structure[OpenAPI 3.0 specification].
====

Note that these are exceptions to the rule that API resource URLs shouldn't have a file extension.

.`doc` resource
====
```
 /doc
     /swagger.json
     /swagger.yaml
     /<optional other documentation>
 /<resource1>
     /...
 /<resource2>
     /...
 ...
```
====

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Reusable OpenAPI definitions
====
Instead of specifying everything directly in the `swagger.yaml` file of an API, OpenAPI allows to reference data types and other definitions from other reusable files.
These files SHOULD follow the Swagger/OpenAPI file format as well and may include data type definitions, but also parameter, path items and response objects.

To work around limitations of certain tools, a conversion step to inline the definitions into the `swagger.yaml` file may be necessary.

Duplication of types in multiple APIs SHOULD be avoided. Rather, put the type in a reusable OpenAPI file.
Files reusable from multiple APIs SHOULD be organized in this structure:
```
<domain>/<version>/<domain-version>.yaml
<domain>/<subdomain>/<version>/<domain-subdomain-version>.yaml
```

Definitions SHOULD be grouped per (sub)domain in a file.
Each file has its own lifecycle, with a major version number in it's directory and file name, that is increased when backwards compatibility is broken.
This version, with optionally a minor and patch version added to it, MUST be specified in the `info` section in the swagger file as well.
====

While it is not strictly necessary for external definitions to be put in a valid OpenAPI 2.0 file, doing so makes it possible to use standard OpenAPI/Swagger tooling on them.

.Reusable OpenAPI file
====
.person-identifier-v1.yaml
```YAML
swagger: "2.0"
info:
  title: data types for person identifiers
  version: v1beta
paths: {} # empty paths property required to be a valid OpenAPI file
definitions:
  Ssin:
    description: "Social Security Identification Number issued by the National Register or CBSS"
    type: string
    pattern: \d{11}
```

A type can be referenced from another OpenAPI file:
```YAML
"$ref": http://example.org/person/identifier/v1#/definitions/Ssin
```
====

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Common definitions for Belgian government institutions
====
Common definitions for use by Belgian government institutions are published on https://www.gcloud.belgium.be/rest/schemas/.
Types in these schemas SHOULD be used instead of defining your own variants.

(TODO: this path is not yet navigable).

The technical types referenced in this style guide are available in the `common` and `problem` subpath.
Other types for business concepts commonly used by Belgian government institutions are added in other subpaths.

The OpenAPI files will be made available both in YAML and JSON format through content negotiation (see <<Media Types>>), with YAML being the default format.
(TODO: only available as <type>.yaml currently)
====

=== JSON data types

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Data type names
====
Data type names SHOULD be defined in American English and use _UpperCamelCase_ notation.
For abbreviations as well, all letters except the first one should be lowercased.
====

`additionalProperties` can be used to put restrictions on other properties of a JSON object than those specified in the schema.

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.additionalProperties
====
`additionalProperties` SHOULD be used exclusively to describe an object representing a map of key-value pairs.
The keys of such maps don't need to respect the naming rules for JSON properties (lowerCamelCase and English).
====

An example is the description a map of `embedded` resources, as described in <<Embedded resources>>.
Other uses of `additionalProperties` than for maps are to be avoided, in order to support schema evolution.

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.readOnly properties
====
Properties SHOULD  be declared readOnly when appropriate.

Properties can be declared `readOnly: true`.
This means that it MAY be sent as part of a response but MUST NOT be sent as part of the request.
Properties marked as readOnly being true SHOULD NOT be in the required list of the defined schema.

Examples are properties that are computed from other properties, or that represent a volatile state of a resource.
====

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.Enum values
====
A fixed list of possible values of a property can be specified using `enum`.
However, this may make it harder to change the list of possible values, as client applications will often depend on the specified list e.g. by using code generation.

`enum` SHOULD only be used when the list of values is unlikely to change or when changing it has a big impact on clients of the API.

Enumerated string values SHOULD be declared in lowerCamelCase, just as property names.
====

.Enum declaration
====
```YAML
state:
  type: string
  enum:
  - processing
  - failed
  - done
```
====

[.rule, caption="Rule {counter:rule-number}: "]
.String and integer types
====
When defining the type for a property representing a numerical code or ID:

* if the values constitute a list of sequentially generated codes (e.g. gender ISO code), `type: integer` SHOULD be used. It is RECOMMENDED to further restrict the format of the type (e.g. `format: int32`).
* if the values are of fixed length or not sequentially generated, `type: string` SHOULD be used (e.g. Ssin, EnterpriseNumber). This avoids leading zeros to be hidden.
