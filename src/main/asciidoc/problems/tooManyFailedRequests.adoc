= Too Many Failed Requests
:nofooter:

*Status code* 429 Too Many Requests

*Description* No more new requests are accepted because the consumer quota for failed requests was exceeded.
The property `limit` contains the number of failed requests allowed.
`retryAfter` or `retryAfterSec` indicate when the consumer may submit new requests again, respectively at a specific time or as a number of seconds after the reply.
The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After[Retry-After HTTP header] conveys the same information.
